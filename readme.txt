Add an easy tool to manage order shipping information of your shop and to notified your customers about the shipping.

== Description ==

YITH Woocommerce Order Tracking is a WordPress plugin that allows you to manage easily shipping information concerning your orders and that lets your customers be notified about their order shipping.

= Save precious time and feel free to focus only on your business activity =

You do not have to spend your precious time to manage telephone calls and emails from your customers, who want to know if their order has been shipped.
Devote yourself and your time to more profitable activities for your online shop and make communication with your customers be managed automatically each time one of your orders is set as "shipped".

= Main features =

* Do you ship your order always or mainly with the same carrier? You don't have to add this information, every shipping will be prearranged with the default carrier.
* Customize the message you want to show to your users in the order detail.
* Use some placeholders to fill automatically the carrier details, the tracking code and the shipping date.
* Choose the place in the order detail where you want to show the message to your users: you can place it before or after the order content.
* Manage easily the tracking details of the shipping from the related order page in the back end.
* Identify smoothly which orders have been shipped and which are waiting for from the "Orders" page in the back end.
